**Artificial Intelligence :** 
The effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans
AI can be simple or complex, and mostly deals with simulating intellectual human tasks
Basic AI relies on humans to provide them with rules
In todays world ML, DL, NN are a part of AI
AI > ML > NN

**Machine Learning :** 
tries to figure out the rules for itself by using the data and the required output
& this is why to make a good model you need more data for the model to actually learn from it & this is also the reason why they are almost never 100% accurate
So unlike classical programming where we define the rules and data and the computer gives us the answer, in ML we feed the computer data and answer and it provides us with rules

**Neural Networks :**
It is a form of ML that uses a layered representation of data (to kind of simulate the way neurons work in animals)

**DATA :**
*Features :* the data we always provide as input
*Label :* is the output we are trying to predict
So we give labels to a model and it returns labels
*Training Data :* the data that is used to train the model, it has all the features and labels
*Testing Data :* the data used to test the model, it only has features and labels are generated by the program and then checked if they were actually accurate or not
Therefore we need correct data to be inputted to get proper results 

**Definitions :**
*AI :* Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines/computers
*ML :* Development of computer systems that are able to learn and adapt without being explicitly programmed
*DL :* Subset of machine learning inspired by our brains (neurons via use of NN), this is an approach
*NN :* It is a network of artificial neurons/nodes that mimic the way human brain operates(having multiple layers and interconnects), this is a model
