In my personal experience I used to find quantitative aptitude the easiest section followed by verbal ability and logical reasoning. One needs to prepare well for all the sections in order to pass the test as some companies will keep sectional cut-offs, so you need to prepare and clear all 3 sections in order to pass the assessment.



**How to prepare?**

The answer to this question is simple you need to invest your time. Every day you need to pick a topic go through the theory part first and then pick up questions related to that topic and start solving. Next day starts with a new topic. Weekends are meant for revisions. All the topics which you are preparing needs revision or else your whole preparation will become worthless. In this way you can cover all topics of all the sections within a time span of 45 days.



**From where to prepare?**

There are numerous resources available online to prepare. You can go through YouTube videos explaining a particular topic or you can go through articles associated with that particular topic. I suggest preparing from YouTube and the channel I recommend is Career Ride. You can even prepare from book, the book which I recommend is Quantitative Aptitude by Dr R. S. Aggarwal.

Finally, I would only like to suggest that clearing aptitude test is not a matter of luck. You need to work on it. You need to keep yourself motivated and daily try to cover at least 1 topic.
