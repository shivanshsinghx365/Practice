USES OF LOOPS -->
1. To do something repeatedly
2. To iterate through containers like arrays, list, etc.
3. To run something forever like web servers or other system services (they are always checking for new requests/action by users)
4. To do something again and again while a particular condition holds true

When iterating through n array where i can be used as index of array as well, we use for loop
or if we have simple syntax, like we are modifying i by fixed amounts we use for loop

When we have more complex logics with different modifications in different cases, we prefer while loops
bcz while loop has flexibility to put increment decrement anywhere

in for loop ideally increment/decrement is  as the last statement, otherwise it becomes difficult to repeatedly

while loop is also preferred in infinite loops like in servers, while(True) is infinite

do while loops is exit controlled loop, other 2 were entry controlled, which means first thing is done then condition is checked
do-while executes at least once
