---- APPLICATIONS OF FUNCTIONS ----
1. Avoid code redundancy/duplicacy (example you have to check even/odd at multiple places in program, you put its code in a function and call it as required without coding for it again and again)
2. Make code modular (divides the program into smaller, easier to read & manage sub-parts)
3. Increases program readability
4. Divide a complex problem into simpler ones
5. Reduces chances of error
6. Modifying a program becomes easier
7. Abstraction (example: in library functions we don't need to worry about how they work)
8. It makes code more maintainable (making changes require you to make change in just one function instead of whole program)
