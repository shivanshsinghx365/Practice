A function is a block of code that takes some input and returns some output,
however these inputs and outputs are optional.
Function can also be considered as a block of code that performs certain operation.

Every C++ program has a main function, execution always begins from the first line of this main function
When function call is encountered, the main function's state is saved till that point
and the control goes to the function definition
after this when function ends the control returns back to the main program and normal execution continues
from the same point where it had stopped

in other word's the state of caller function is saved till the point of function call
and control goes to called function, when called function is completed
the control returns to the caller function, and execution continues from the previously saved state

functions can be called within same or other functions too, apart from main

function execution ends when it reaches the last line or the return statement

when function ends memory is released and if there are returned values then they are passed to the place they were called at/by

function calls follow the principle of LIFO last in first out, as apparent in case there are functions within functions
