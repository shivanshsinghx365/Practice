In many situations we might want to store composite objects, Example :
1. A point in 2d coordinate system which has 2 members x,y
2. To store a students info in one place, like his name, marks,address,etc
3. For a webpage we might want to store its url, content and number of view etc

so, to tackle this we have structures : 
Structures in C/C++ allow us to store multiple items together. These items can be of any data type, its not necessary for all of them to have same data-type

Structure is also called a "User-defined" data type because the user specifies how these members are stored and what all members a structure will have.

in c language we many times use typedef with structures, the purpose is to avoid typing that long code

it is mainly meant for C, and was added to c++ for backward-compatibility and also to support composite data-types (data-types that support multiple members)

C++ has class and using that we can do almost anything we can do using structures
so they are mostly redundant but can still be usefull
