### **Command Line Arguments**
---

Many times when we write a program in java we want to build a utility which can be used on the command prompt/terminal. So, we allow the users to input the input parameters in the command line itself and the program processes these inputs

Example :
>> javac test.java
>> java test
No arguments
>> java test abc 124
arguments are abc & 124

Why do we need Command Line Arguments?
To create utilities/programs that can be used directly from the command line, and have arguments that can be passed to perform the task faster and more efficiently
