### **First Program**

To begin development in Java  we need to setup our environment : 

1. JDK : 
a free-open-source java development kit by Oracle
It contains everything required to run java code
It contains JVM(java virtual machine)+ Java Class Library (Together these 2 are called JRE; Java Runtime Environment)
It also contains Dev Tools
JVM can be implemented in 2 ways : 
    a. we have **interpreter** than line by line converts the code and executes it
    b. **Just-in-Time Compilation** this takes the byte-code and converts it to the machine specific code in one go, this is most preferred way, because it is faster

2. IDE : 
These are required to save, write and manage the code, we don't actually require an ide, we can also work with a text editor(gEdit,notepad,etc) and a terminal
Its just that IDE's improve your efficiency with extra features
IntelliJ, BlueJ Eclipse, VS Code, Online Compilers

3. CLASS_PATH : 
Path variable decides where all commands might be present when we type a command in the console
Class path is for java, when we run java program it is located via class path
Class path is the variable we specify root directories of all the projects that we want to run or use

Java Class Libraries are standard libraries which are required to run Java Programs

Dev Tools are the tools that are required for development like Java Compiler, Java Debugger, Java Document Generator and so on.

The PATH is an environment variable which the shell (or other command interpreter) uses to search for commands. 

* A method is a procedure or function in object-oriented programming.
* A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program
