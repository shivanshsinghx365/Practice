Class -- Blue print or Skeleton of your object
        -- Combination of objects
        -- No memory is used to define it without objects

Object -- An instance of a class
        -- Memory is utilized to create an object
    
Example:        

class Class_Name{
    Access Specifier;     //can be public,private or protected
    Data members;         //Variables to be used
    Member functions(){}; //Methods to access data members
};                        //Class name ends with a semicolon;

Private : can not be accessed outside the class,
          can only be accessed using member functions of the class
Public : It is accessible to everyone outside the class
Protected : Are accessible to class itself and its child classes

:: is called binary scope operator
functions defined inside class are by default taken as inline functions
member functions and function are same thing
each object is allocated its own memory
to access private functions we use accessor and mutator, or getter and setter

syntax of defining function outside: 
(for this the function must still be publicly declared in the class)

return_type class_name::function_name(parameters){code}
