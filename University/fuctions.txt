Function: a group of statements that together perform a task
Benefits: saves memory, reduces redundancy, performs a bunch of tasks are performed
- in normal function the control is passed to the function from the main program
- but in inline function the control is not passed, instead the lines of function are placed in
main program itself, it is useful if the function only has one or two statement, if there are
more lines then the program automatically becomes normal
-inline functions speeds up program by avoiding function calling overhead
    -saves overhead of variable pop/push on the stack, when function calling happens
    -it saves overhead of return call from a functions
