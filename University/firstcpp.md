#Basics
##OOPS using c++
*object oriented
*pre-compiled
*intermediate-level language

compilation begins at int main()
##Features of c++ programs
-object is an instance

##operators in c++
arithmetic (+,-,%,/,*)
assignment (=)
auto increment & auto decrement (++,--)
logical (&&,||,!)
comparison (<,>,==,!=,>=,<=)
bitwise (&,|,^,~,>>,<<) --> these operators perform operations bit by bit
    example : num1=11 /* equal to 00001011 */
              num2=22 /* equal to 00010110 */
              num1 & num2 =  00000010  (both 1 means 1)
              num1 | num2 =  00011111  (one 1 also means 1)
ternary (?:)
